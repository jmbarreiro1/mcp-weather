# Weather Application with Web Interface

A robust weather application that retrieves current weather information using multiple weather APIs with automatic fallback.

## Features

- Get current weather conditions for any city
- Automatic fallback between AccuWeather and OpenWeatherMap APIs
- Web interface with a clean, responsive design
- Command-line interface available
- Supports multiple languages
- Handles multi-word city names and common prefixes
- Displays temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, and wind speed

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AccuWeather API key (get one from [AccuWeather Developer Portal](https://developer.accuweather.com/))
- OpenWeatherMap API key (get one from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmbarreiro1/mcp-weather.git
   cd mcp-weather
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   # Required: At least one API key is required
   ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=your_accuweather_api_key_here
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Note: The application will work with just one API key, but having both provides better reliability.

## Running the Application

### Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

3. Enter a city name in the search box and click "Search" to see the current weather.
   - The results will show which weather service was used
   - The system automatically falls back to the other service if one fails

### Command Line Interface
You can also use the command line interface:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

1. The application first tries to get weather data from AccuWeather
2. If AccuWeather fails or isn't configured, it automatically falls back to OpenWeatherMap
3. For certain cities (like "Vilagarcia de Arousa"), a manual mapping is used for better accuracy
4. The web interface shows which service provided the weather data

## Troubleshooting

- If you get "Could not retrieve weather information", check:
  - Your internet connection
  - API keys in the `.env` file
  - API service status (both AccuWeather and OpenWeatherMap)
  - The console output for detailed error messages

## Usage

- Enter any city name in the search box
- Click the "Search" button or press Enter
- View the current weather conditions including temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, and wind speed
